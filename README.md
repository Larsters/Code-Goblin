# The task
- To develop a CI tool that automatically checks the code quality of Java code in PR's, provide warnings for code style issues.
- The tool will be used as a preliminary code review, making it easier for reviewers to focus on more complex issues.

## Code Quality Analysis
- will be using `Checkstyle` for checking Java code against a set of coding standards and  `PMD` for finding common programming bugs.
- Integration of AI in Code Review

# TODO list
- Train a LLM with Java Style Guide and use it instead of GPT
